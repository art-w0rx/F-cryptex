The program is designed to encrypt files of different formats (archives, text documents, tables, even tested for mp3, it works)
The program requires Python version 3.8 and higher, as well as libraries (pycryptodome, simple-crypt) that can be installed using pip via the console.
How to work:
   1. Copy your file along the path F-cryptex/Files
   2. Run the program
   3. Follow the program menu
  
You can also work with Android, this will require termux and total commander
